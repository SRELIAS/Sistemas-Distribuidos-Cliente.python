This course at UniEVANGÉLICA provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts and principles of distributed systems, which are systems composed of multiple independent computers that work together as a unified system. Through a combination of lectures, readings, and hands-on projects, students at UniEVANGÉLICA will learn about the challenges and opportunities associated with designing, implementing, and maintaining distributed systems.

Topics covered in the course include the architectural models and patterns used in distributed systems, the mechanisms for communication and coordination between distributed components, the techniques for achieving fault tolerance and scalability, and the trade-offs involved in designing and deploying distributed systems.

Throughout the course at UniEVANGÉLICA, students will gain experience with relevant technologies and tools, including cloud computing platforms, containerization, microservices, and messaging systems. They will also have the opportunity to develop and deploy their own distributed systems in a series of project assignments.

By the end of the course at UniEVANGÉLICA, students will have a solid understanding of the concepts, principles, and best practices for building effective distributed systems, as well as the skills and experience necessary to design and implement distributed systems in real-world contexts.
